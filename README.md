## Introduction
This project involves two parallel implementations of LU decomposition that use Gaussian elimination to factor a dense `N x N` matrix into an upper-triangular one and a lower-triangular one. In matrix computations, pivoting involves finding the largest magnitude value in a row, column, or both and then interchanging rows and/or columns in the matrix for the next step in the algorithm. The purpose of pivoting is to reduce round-off error, which enhances numerical stability. This project uses row pivoting, a form of pivoting involves interchanging rows of a trailing submatrix based on the largest value in the current column. To perform LU decomposition with row pivoting, one needs to compute a permutation matrix P such that PA = LU. The permutation matrix keeps track of row exchanges performed.

My primary objective was to reduce the execution time of the algorithm for large matrices like a `8000 X 8000` matrix leveraging parallel computing techniques like Open-MP and p-thread.

### Pseudo Code
```
Below is pseudocode for a sequential implementation of LU decomposition with row pivoting.
    inputs: a(n,n)
    outputs: π(n), l(n,n), and u(n,n)

    initialize π as a vector of length n
    initialize u as an n x n matrix with 0s below the diagonal
    initialize l as an n x n matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s above the diagonal
    for i = 1 to n
      π[i] = i
    for k = 1 to n
      max = 0
      for i = k to n
        if max < |a(i,k)|
          max = |a(i,k)|
          k' = i
      if max == 0
        error (singular matrix)
      swap π[k] and π[k']
      swap a(k,:) and a(k',:)
      swap l(k,1:k-1) and l(k',1:k-1)
      u(k,k) = a(k,k)
      for i = k+1 to n
        l(i,k) = a(i,k)/u(k,k)
        u(k,i) = a(k,i)
      for i = k+1 to n
        for j = k+1 to n
          a(i,j) = a(i,j) - l(i,k)*u(k,j)
          
    Here, the vector π is a compact representation of a permutation matrix p(n,n), 
    which is very sparse. For the ith row of p, π(i) stores the column index of
    the sole position that contains a 1.
